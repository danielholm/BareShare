BareShare is a backup service just like ie. Dropbox, Ubuntu One, SparkleShare and so on. 

The name is partly a Swedish wordplay meaning ”Just share!”, but also that it Backups, using Rsync, and then just shares.

I created it because I wanted a free, open source backup service that was fast, secure and simple. Rsync (with the help of lsyncd) does the job and together with a simple indicator applet, it is good to go!

Dependencies:
Rsync
Lsyncd
SSH
PyGTK

BareShare 0.1 - Released 120116

This is the very first release which is really rough around the edges and It probably just works for me as of just now. I'll fix it later.

How it works as of now, you have to have rsync and lsyncd installed, have a system supporting indicator applets, Python, GTK and have a working SSH connection to your remote server since it uses your SSH keys at the moment.

Your ldsyncd.conf file has to be in ~/.bareshare/.

It basically runs lsyncd for you and is being handled by the appindicator.


Comming up: 
0.2
* First run guide that acually helps you get your stuff up (client only - you'll have to set up your server by yourself).
* Notifications (libnotify),
* Bandwith limit (rsync built-in --bwlimit=).
* Better rsync support (file scan for non uploaded files initally).
* Initial download of files at startup too.
* Working conf file.
